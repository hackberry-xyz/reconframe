## What is it?
```reconframe``` is a Batteries included, Python Framework for performing small scale to large scale reconnaissance by leveraging the power of the Python Programming Language. Not every software is same. But in the end, recon boils down to gaining information. Unlike traditional scripts, toolsets or software, reconframe focuses on storing, parsing and gaining information using the code provided by you.

## Installation
```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/hackberry-xyz/reconframe.git
```

## Usage
The ```reconframe``` is developed with information parsing in mind. During recon process, an information should be sharable as well as analyzable. For the same reason, ```reconframe``` comes with an embedded ptpython interpreter, a mindful API and stateful environment.

### Interpreter
The ```reconframe```'s interpreter is just a boosted Python interpreter.  ```reconframe``` injects some API utilities so that you don't have to memorize packages and modules:
```sh
$ reconframe
```
